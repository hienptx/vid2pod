Have you ever wondered what 
Capitalism is? In this video,  
we’re going to look at a simple explanation 
of Capitalism as well as the pros and cons.
Capitalism is an economic system in which 
private individuals or businesses own and  
control the means of production, distribution, and 
exchange of goods and services. Under capitalism,  
the pursuit of profit and individual self-interest 
are the driving forces of the economy.
In a capitalist system, individuals are 
free to own property, start businesses,  
and compete with one another in the market. 
Prices are determined by supply and demand,  
and profits are reinvested into 
the economy for further growth.  
The government's role in a capitalist 
system is to ensure a level playing  
field for all market participants, enforce 
contracts, and protect property rights.
There are many different types of 
capitalism, including laissez-faire  
capitalism, where the government plays 
a minimal role, and welfare capitalism,  
where the government intervenes to 
provide a safety net for its citizens.
Next, let’s look at some of the original 
thinkers on Capitalism. One of the most  
famous books on capitalism is "The Wealth of 
Nations" by Adam Smith, which was published  
in 1776. Smith argued that capitalism would 
lead to increased wealth and economic growth,  
as individuals pursued their own self-interest 
and specialization in the production of goods and  
services. Another important thinker on capitalism 
is Karl Marx, who wrote "Das Kapital" in 1867.  
Marx saw capitalism as a system that exploited 
workers and concentrated wealth in the hands of  
a few capitalists. He argued that capitalism 
would eventually lead to its own downfall,  
as workers became aware of their exploitation 
and revolted against the capitalist class.
Next let’s look at the pros and cons of 
Capitalism. Those who argue for Capitalism  
say that it promotes innovation, entrepreneurship, 
and competition, which in turn leads to increased  
economic growth. They argue that this results in a 
higher standard of living for society as a whole.  
Next, they argue that Capitalism allocates 
resources in the most efficient manner possible,  
as the market determines the prices of goods 
and services based on supply and demand,  
which they say ensures that resources are 
used in the most productive way possible.
Supporters of Capitalism also argue 
that it provides individuals with  
the freedom to choose what they 
produce, consume, and invest in  
which allows people to pursue their own 
interests and maximize their potential.  
Lastly, they argue that Capitalism creates 
jobs as businesses expand and new businesses  
are formed. This provides employment opportunities 
and contributes to the reduction of unemployment.
Those on the other side of the debate argue 
that Capitalism can lead to wealth and income  
inequality, as the rewards of economic growth may 
not be distributed evenly. They argue that this  
can result in some individuals or groups having 
a disproportionate amount of power and wealth.  
Next they point out that Capitalism may 
allow for the exploitation of workers,  
as businesses may pay low wages and offer poor 
working conditions in order to increase profits.
Those against Capitalism point that it can have 
negative environmental impacts as businesses  
prioritize profits over environmental concerns. 
This can lead to pollution and the degradation  
of natural resources. Lastly, those against 
Capitalism argue that it can be subject to  
economic cycles of booms and busts, which can 
lead to economic instability and uncertainty.
